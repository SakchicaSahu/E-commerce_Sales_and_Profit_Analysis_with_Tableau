## Tableau : Tableau is an excellent data visualization and business intelligence tool used for reporting and analyzing vast volumes of data. It helps users create different charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and stories for visualizing and analyzing data, to help in making business decisions. 

## Tableau supports powerful data discovery and exploration that enables users to answer important questions in seconds
**In this project I tried to answer following questions**

Q-1 Analysing the sales and profit by each state?

Q-2 Finding the top Profitable state?

Q-3 Analysing sales and profit by category and sub category ?

Q-4 How do we represent sales and profit data at the sametime for every state?
